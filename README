My solution should be mostly straight forward. I did have some trouble with figuring out where the file writing
should live. Originally, I had the DAS files being written from the Hardware layer, but I had to add an additional
method that wasn't listed in the assignment, so I ended up moving the DAS file writing to the MachineControl layer to
try and keep to the assignment sheet.

I used a pojo to pass my control values because I thought it was easier/cleaner than using a hash or array list.

I used integers instead of a clock and real seconds. The actual clock portion didn't seem central to the assignment,
and just using ints as units of time vs full seconds gives me the same results without the wait.

I have a couple methods in my facades that I didn't need to implement, but I decided to leave them in
to show that the functionality can be accessed from each facade.
